# envterpolate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nparry/envterpolate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nparry/envterpolate)

envsubst (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/envsubst.1.html)
created as an exercise to try out go.

Even with the existence of envsubst, this seems to be a common question...
